            <h2>What actually a Guitar is?</h2>
            <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat
                against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while
                simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum
                or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected
                either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic
                pickup and an amplifier.

              
                
                The guitar is classified as a chordophone â€“ meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string
                stretched between two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings
                made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the
                United States;[1] nylon strings came in the 1940s.[1] The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the
                vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which
                contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.
